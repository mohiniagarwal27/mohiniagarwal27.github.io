			<h2>Demonstrated achievements</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The Heavy Water Plant Kota was the first plant set up on H2S-H2O exchange based on indigenous technology. Many changes and improvements were carried out under my guidance. As a result the energy consumption per kg of heavy water produced has been
					brought down to 54% of original design values with 30% more production than design.
				</li>
				<li>The plant operates with 180 MT inventory of H2S gas, which is very toxic and corrosive. Safety of operating and maintenance personnel is a big concern. During my period of plant operation no events of H2S exposure, public complaints or fatalities/
					injuries.
				</li>
				<li>
					Reviewed design of a facility for distillation of boron complex for separation of boron isotopes, plant worked very well.
				</li>
				<li>Worked for development and deployment of catalyst for H2-H2O exchange reactions using platinum doped carbon aero gels, designed CECE plant facility for heavy water up gradation or de-tritiation of heavy water.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>REGARDING POWER PLANTS</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					After analyzing two nuclear power stations at Kakrapara (each 236 MWe rated generation) I established that total thermodynamic losses exceeded 10% of rated capacity. It would have been possible to increase power generation by 6% of rated capacity, and/
					or reduce fuel consumption by 10%. Much of these losses could be recovered.
				</li>
				<li>
					We can assemble a team of experts and look into any type of problems for power plants, boilers, and steam cycles. We can diagnose and provide solutions.
				</li>
				<li>We can study your boiler and steam cycle/ turbine operation. After we analyze your power plant the thermodynamic analysis will reveal where you are losing money by losing heat and power generation.
				</li>
				<li>Our present offer is limited to analysis and identification of thermodynamic/ energy losses. If you want us to suggest solutions, that will require further analysis and be another phase of activities.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="twooooo">
			<h2>METHODOLOGY OF WORKING</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>We will visit your installation and collect following information:
					<ol>
						<li>Plant design data , original heat balance diagrams -- as the baseline data for comparison along with plant flow sheets / P&I diagrams
						</li>
						<li>Plant operating data will be compiled
						</li>
						<li>Your compilation of known deficiencies (quantified) will be useful
						</li>
						<li>In case there are inconsistencies in the measurements, we will point out and request for rectification / recalibration of instruments
						</li>
						<li>We shall analyze and give you compilation of the results of analysis so that you can take corrective actions
						</li>
						<li>In case you want further analysis of the performance of available equipment, we can take up as additional work. This will help you to plan for the rectifications.
						</li>
						<li>We shall mobilize experts as needed e.g. certified energy managers, for boiler, coal transportation, control systems, analytical chemistry, steam cycle and turbines etc. They shall be scientists and engineers with many decades of actual plant experience
							in relevant fields.
						</li>
						<li>After the rectifications have been carried out then within three months we can repeat the analysis and quantify what has been achieved / what could not be achieved.</li>
					</ol>

			<h2>HOW MUCH DO WE CHARGE</h2>
			<p>We charge nothing to take up the work. You have only to take care of our incidental expenses like journeys (starting from metros / prime cities), boarding, lodging and office expenses.</p>
			<p>As you are able to realize the deficiencies and losses with potential to increase power generation / reduce fuel consumption, the potential for profits would become apparent. Then we can share the profits. This arrangement will ensure that you are always the gainer.</p>
			<p>Other modalities can also be discussed e.g. lump sum charges.</p>
